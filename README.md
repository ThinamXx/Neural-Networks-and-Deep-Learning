## **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**

**Neural Networks**
- Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.

**Deep Learning**
- Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

**Note:**
- All the Notebooks included in this repository presents the Implementation of Neural Networks in Deep Learning. These Notebooks are taken from the courses which I have completed from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). I have included insightful Notebooks such as:
